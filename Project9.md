## Tooling Website deployment automation with Continuous Integration. Introduction to Jenkins

This project is about automation of routine tasks. In this project we are going to start automating part of our routine tasks with a free and open source automation server called Jenkins. It is one of the most popular CI/CD tools, it was created by a former Sun Microsystems developer Kohsuke Kawaguchi and the project was originally named “Hudson”. So siimply put, Jenkins is a free and open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery.
 
Following from project 8, we will be utilising Jenkins CI capabilities to make sure that every change made to the source code in GitHub https://github.com/BimsDevs/tooling will be automatically be updated to the Tooling Website.
 
According to CircleCI, Continuous integration (CI) is a software development strategy that increases the speed of development while ensuring the quality of the code that teams deploy. Developers continually commit code in small increments (at least daily, or even several times a day), which is then automatically built and tested before it is merged with the shared repository.
 
 
Task
Enhance the architecture prepared in Project 8 by adding a Jenkins server, configure a job to automatically deploy source codes changes from Git to NFS server.
Here is how your update architecture will look like upon competion of this project:
